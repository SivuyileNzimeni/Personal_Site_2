I have a defined-benefit retirement plan with annual COLA offered by our national affiliate. I have a separate 401(k) that my employer contributes a fixed dollar amount to every year that's more than 5% of my gross (which is more than I ever expected to save from my contribution *plus* employer matching). I have the best health insurance I've ever heard of with the premium fully paid and $3500 a year in FSA/HRA contributions. We have real, substantial PTO and more staff actually taking it than I've ever seen at a union. They paid my relocation from across the country, which is normally unheard-of except for national union jobs at the management level. Plus a collective bargaining agreement with just cause, progressive discipline, representation, and all the other stuff you don't know you need until you don't have it.
