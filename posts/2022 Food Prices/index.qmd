[Food Price inflation](https://theconversation.com/rising-food-prices-hit-poor-people-the-hardest-a-close-look-at-inflation-in-south-africa-184465#:~:text=South%20Africa's%20overall%20rate%20of,2%25%20over%20the%20same%20period.) has been the subject of much media coverage. Obtaining source data to assess prices changes across of a variety of food products can be a difficult exercise. Aside from Statistics South Africa, Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice & Dignity group (PMBEJD) and others provide regular estimates of price changes. On the other hand,the [Trundler API](https://www.trundler.dev) provides a robust API to track prices across many retailers in South Africa and abroad. Below, we use the Trundler API to access data for six food categories namely: 

1.  Eggs

2.  Milk

3.  Maize

4.  Rice

5.  Sunflower Oil

6.  White Sugar

Using the Trundler API, we narrowed the product search to a handful of competing products in two large South African Retailers. As a result, we don't share the data extraction process in this post to protect the data extracted and API keys associated with them.

The table below provides an overview of food prices for the period 2020 - 2022.  The able is interactive, one can sort by food category, retailer id, date columns and price.
